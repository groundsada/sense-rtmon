"""Offline checks for the Archify topology panel.

No Grafana, no SENSE-O, no real network and - crucially - no Node and no
vendored Archify tree. The runtime lives in the rtmon-archify sidecar, so
these tests stand up a small HTTP server that implements its contract and
check the RTMon half against that. The sidecar's own test suite (node --test)
checks the real renderer; this file checks that RTMon builds the right thing,
asks for it over HTTP, and degrades every failure into a dashboard warning.

The fixtures beside this file are real ordered path models - the shape
findorder() leaves in self.orderlist - so the interesting half of the feature
can be checked against genuine multi-domain, multipoint and BGP reservations.

Run from the repository root:

    python3 test/test_archify.py

Exits non-zero on the first failure and prints what failed.

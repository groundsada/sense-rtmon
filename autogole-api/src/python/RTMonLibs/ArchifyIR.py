"""Archify architecture IR built from the path model RTMon already has.

Pure functions over plain dicts: no filesystem, no subprocess, no Grafana. The
side effects live in RTMonLibs/Archify.py, which is what makes this half
testable against the manifest fixtures in test/ without a deployment.

The input is the model the Mermaid walk leaves behind - self.orderlist, the
ordered Host/Switch chain findorder() produced - not the manifest. findorder()
consumes manifest["Ports"] as it walks, so there is only one walk to be had and
both diagrams have to share it.

Where this differs from the Mermaid graph, deliberately:

  Mermaid draws a node per switch *port*, plus a node per VLAN, per IP and per
  BGP peer. That is complete, and on a multi-domain path it is also unreadable.
  Here a component is a *device*, ports and VLANs become connection labels, and
  the addressing detail moves into cards. The two panels are shown together, so
  the detail Mermaid carries is never actually lost - it is just not in this
  picture.

"""Archify topology panel: artifact generation and lifecycle.

The second of the two top-of-dashboard diagrams. Mermaid draws the complete
graph - every port, VLAN, address and BGP peer - and this draws the path at
device level, with the detail moved into cards beside it. Both are rendered,
because they answer different questions and neither replaces the other.

Split from ArchifyIR on purpose: everything that talks to the network is
here, and the IR construction next door stays a pure function of the path
model, which is what lets test/test_archify.py check the interesting half
without a deployment.

The Archify runtime itself does not live in this repository. It runs in the
rtmon-archify sidecar (github.com/groundsada/rtmon-archify), which validates
and renders the IR and serves the artifact. This class is an HTTP client for
it: build the IR, POST it, point the panel's iframe at the served URL.
Everything else - the fallback ladder, the sweep, the teardown - stays here,
because the failure budget of a dashboard belongs with the thing that owns
the dashboard.

The output is one self-contained ~200 KB (gzipped) HTML file per dashboard,
owned and served by the sidecar. It is not inlined into the dashboard JSON:
the archify runtime shell alone is 760 KB before any diagram is drawn, so
every dashboard would carry most of a megabyte of identical payload into
Grafana's database.

Nothing here is allowed to fail a dashboard. Sidecar down, renderer rejecting
the layout, a render that hangs - each one ends the same way, with a warning
in the dashboard's own "Graph Generation Warnings" row and no Archify panel.
The Mermaid panel is right there and still complete.
